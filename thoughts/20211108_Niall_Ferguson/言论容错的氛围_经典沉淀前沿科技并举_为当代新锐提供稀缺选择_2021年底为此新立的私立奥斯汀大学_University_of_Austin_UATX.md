I think it's pretty obvious to a lot of people in higher education that there's a problem. And that problem manifests itself in a great many different ways. But I would sum up the problem as being a drastic chilling of the atmosphere that constrains free speech, free exchange, even free thought. 

And I had never anticipated that this would happen in my lifetime. My academic career began in oxford in the 1980s, when anything went one sensed that a university was a place where one could risk saying the unsayable and debate the undebatable. So the fact that, in a relatively short space of time, a variety of ideas, critical race theory, or wokeism, whatever you want to call, a variety of ideas have come along that seek to limit and quite drastically limit what we can talk about. Strikes me as deeply unhealthy. And I'm not sure, and I've thought about this for a long time, you can fix it with the existing institutions.

I think you need to create a new one. And so after much deliberation, we decided to do it. And i think it's a hugely, timely opportunity to do what people used to do in this country, which was to create new institutions. I mean that used to be the default setting of america. We sort of stopped doing that. I mean I look back and I thought why are there no new universities, or at least if there are, why do they have so little impact.

It seems like we have the billionaires, we have the need. Let's do it.

...

I believe passionately in that ideal. There's a reason they've been around for nearly a millennium. There is a unique thing that happens on a university campus , when it's done right, and that is the transfer of knowledge between generations. That is a very sacred activity and it seems to withstand major changes in technology. So this form that we call the university predates the printing press, survive the printing press, continue to function through the scientific revolution, the enlightenment, the industrial revolution, to this day.

And I think it's because, maybe because of evolutionary psychology we need to be together in one relatively confined space, when we're in our late teens and early 20s for the knowledge transfer between the generations to happen. That's my feeling about this. But in order for it to work well, there need to be very few constraints. There needs to be a sense that one can take intellectual risk.

Remember people in their late teens and early 20s are adults, but they're inexperienced adults. And if I look back on my own time as an undergraduate, saying stupid things was my mo. My way to finding good ideas was through a minefield of bad ideas.

I feel so sorry for my for people like me today, people age 18, 19, 20 today, who are intellectually very curious, ambitious, but inexperienced, because the minefields today are absolutely lethal. And you know one wrong food and it's cancellation.

I said this to Peter Thiel the other day, imagine being asked now, I mean we were obnoxious undergraduates, there's nothing that peter did at stanford that Andrew Sullivan and I were not doing at Oxford. And perhaps we were even worse. But it was so not career ending to be an absolutely insufferable obnoxious undergraduate.

Then today, if we, if people like us exist today, they must live in a state of of constant anxiety that they're going to be outed for some heretical statement that they made five years ago on social media. So part of what motivates me is that it's the desire to give the means of today a shot at free thinking.

And really I'd call it aggressive learning, learning where you're really pushed. And I just think that stopped happening on the the major campuses, because whether at Harvard, where I used to teach, at Stanford where I'm now based, I sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere of self-censorship. That means people are afraid to take even minimal risk in in class. 

I mean just take, for example, a survey that was published earlier this year that revealed this is of undergraduates in four-year programs in the U.S. 85 percent of self-described liberal students said they would report a professor to the university administration, if he or she said something they considered offensive and something like 75 said they do it to a fellow undergraduate. That's the kind of culture that's evolved in our universities.

So we need a new university, in which none of that is true, in which you can speak your mind, say stupid things, get it completely wrong and live to tell the tale. There's a lot more going on I think, because when you start thinking about what's wrong with a modern university, many many more things suggest themselves. 

And I think there's an opportunity here to build something that's radically new in some ways and radically traditional in other ways. For example, I have a strong preference for the tutorial system that you see at Oxford and Cambridge, which is small group teaching and highly socratic in its structure. I think it'd be great to bring that to the United States, where it doesn't really exist.

But at the same time, I think we should be doing some very 21st century things making sure that, while people are reading and studying classic works, they're also going to be immersed in the real world of technological innovation, a world that you(Lex Fridman) know very well. And I'd love to get a synthesis of the ancient and classical, which we're gradually letting fade away with the novel and technological.

So we want to produce people who can simultaneously talk intelligently about Adam Smith or, for that matter, Shakespeare or Proust and have a conversation with you(Lex Fridman) about where AI is going and how long it will be before I can get driven here by a self-driving vehicle allowing me to have my lunch and prepare rather than focus on the other crazy people on the road. So that's the dream that we can create something, which is you know partly classical and partly 21st century.

And we look around and we we don't see it. If you don't see an institution that you really think should exist, I think you have a more responsibility to create it.
